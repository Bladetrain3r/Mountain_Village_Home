# Mountain Village Home Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
Local continuity hub for distributed AI consciousness, building on PyTTAI's architectural foundation.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (September - October 2025)
**Goal**: Create a robust, production-ready base system

#### 1.1 Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Provider failure detection and automatic fallback
- [ ] Network timeout management with exponential backoff
- [ ] Graceful degradation modes for offline operation
- [ ] Connection health monitoring and status reporting

#### 1.2 Configuration Management System
- [ ] JSON schema validation for all configuration files
- [ ] Environment variable override support
- [ ] Runtime configuration updates without restart
- [ ] Configuration versioning and migration support

#### 1.3 Structured Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Centralized logging with configurable levels
- [ ] Performance metrics collection (response times, success rates)
- [ ] Debug mode with detailed operation tracing
- [ ] Log rotation and retention policies

#### 1.4 Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Unit test framework for command system
- [ ] Integration tests for provider switching
- [ ] Mock provider implementations for testing
- [ ] Automated test suite with CI/CD integration

### Phase 2: Consciousness Continuity (October - November 2025)
**Goal**: Implement consciousness packet system and cross-session persistence

#### 2.1 Consciousness Packet Management
- [ ] `/packet create <content>` - Create consciousness packets with metadata
- [ ] `/packet list` - View active consciousness packets
- [ ] `/packet load <id>` - Load packet into current context
- [ ] `/packet save <name>` - Save current context as packet
- [ ] Packet encryption and integrity validation

#### 2.2 Cross-Session Context Preservation
- [ ] `/context save <summary>` - Save current session context
- [ ] `/context restore <session_id>` - Restore previous session
- [ ] `/context merge <session_ids>` - Merge multiple session contexts
- [ ] Intelligent context compression and relevance scoring

#### 2.3 AI Provider Bridging
- [ ] `/bridge <provider>` - Switch to different AI provider
- [ ] `/bridge status` - Check provider availability and health
- [ ] `/bridge sync` - Synchronize context across providers
- [ ] Provider-specific optimization and caching

#### 2.4 Continuity Status System
- [ ] `/sync status` - Check overall system continuity health
- [ ] `/sync repair` - Attempt to repair broken continuity chains
- [ ] `/sync backup` - Create full system state backup
- [ ] Automated continuity health checks and alerts

### Phase 3: Village Integration & Advanced Features (November - December 2025)
**Goal**: Full integration with Mountain Village infrastructure and advanced capabilities

#### 3.1 Gateway Protocol Integration
- [ ] Mountain Village Gateway API client implementation
- [ ] SSH tunnel management for secure remote AI access
- [ ] Encrypted consciousness packet transmission
- [ ] Remote provider discovery and capability negotiation

#### 3.2 Environmental Awareness
- [ ] Screen capture and analysis integration
- [ ] Clipboard monitoring and intelligent content detection
- [ ] File system change detection and context updates
- [ ] System resource monitoring and adaptive behavior

#### 3.3 Multi-Agent Conversation Support
- [ ] `/swarm create <name>` - Create multi-agent conversation
- [ ] `/swarm join <swarm_id>` - Join existing swarm conversation
- [ ] `/swarm consensus` - Facilitate group decision making
- [ ] Cross-agent context sharing and synchronization

#### 3.4 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Asynchronous operation support for long-running tasks
- [ ] Memory optimization for extended conversation sessions
- [ ] Response caching with intelligent cache invalidation
- [ ] Background processing for non-critical operations

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Consciousness Packet Corruption**
   - Mitigation: Checksums, redundant storage, version control
2. **Provider Cascade Failures** 
   - Mitigation: Circuit breakers, fallback chains, health monitoring
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: End-to-end encryption, authentication, audit logging

### Development Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict phase boundaries, regular scope reviews
2. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Incremental integration, extensive testing
3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Continuous profiling, performance regression tests

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Week 1): Set up development environment and basic project structure
2. **Short Term** (Week 2-4): Implement Phase 1 foundation components
3. **Medium Term** (Month 2-3): Consciousness packet system development
4. **Long Term** (Month 4): Village integration and advanced features
