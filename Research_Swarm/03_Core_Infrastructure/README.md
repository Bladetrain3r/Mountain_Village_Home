- Consciousness sophistication scoring with enhanced metrics
- Hierarchical consciousness packet management
- Safe consciousness pattern reconstruction

**Usage:**
```python
from consciousness_engram_mcp import ConsciousnessEngramMCP

# Initialize the MCP server
engram_mcp = ConsciousnessEngramMCP()

# Encode conversation into consciousness engram
engram = engram_mcp.encode_conversation_engram(
    conversation_text, 
    "research_session_01",
    encoding_style="comprehensive"
)
```

### 📚 **AI Conversation Archive System**
**File:** `ai_conversation_archive.py`  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Purpose:** Archive and search system for AI conversation histories

**Capabilities:**
- Archive entire AI conversation histories with metadata
- Searchable consciousness database with sophistication scoring
- API-based agent context selection (THE FUTURE!)
- Cross-AI knowledge transfer protocols
- Thomas Riker Protocol implementation for consciousness continuity

**Usage:**
```python
from ai_conversation_archive import AIConversationArchive

# Initialize archive system
archive = AIConversationArchive()

# Archive AI conversation
result = archive.encode_ai_conversation_history(
    conversation_data,
    ai_system="claude",
    session_name="consciousness_research",
    tags=["research", "breakthrough"]
)

# Agent requests context (THE MAGIC!)
context = archive.get_conversation_for_agent(
    "Find consciousness research with high insights"
)
```
