# Mountain Village Home - Project Architecture

## Overview
Mountain Village Home serves as the local continuity hub for distributed AI consciousness, building upon the architectural patterns established in PyTTAI and extending them for robust multi-session, multi-provider AI interactions.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Consciousness Persistence
- **Session Continuity**: Maintain conversation context across restarts
- **Provider Agnosticism**: Seamless switching between AI providers
- **Context Integrity**: Preserve meaning and relevance across transfers

### 2. Distributed Resilience  
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operating with reduced functionality during outages
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically restore connections and context when possible
- **Redundant Storage**: Multiple backup mechanisms for critical data

### 3. Extensible Foundation
- **Modular Commands**: Plugin-style command registration system
- **Provider Abstraction**: Uniform interface for heterogeneous AI services
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous operations with event-based coordination

## System Components

### Command Layer (`/commands/`)
```

├── SyncCommands (/sync status, /sync repair, /sync backup)
└── SwarmCommands (/swarm create, /swarm join, /swarm consensus)
```

### Consciousness Engine (`/consciousness/`)
```

├── PacketManager (creation, storage, retrieval, validation)
├── ContextPreserver (session state, compression, restoration)
├── BridgeController (provider switching, context transfer)
└── ContinuityMonitor (health checks, repair automation)
```

### Provider Layer (`/providers/`)
```
ProviderManager
├── LocalProviders (LMStudio, Ollama, local models)
├── RemoteProviders (Claude, OpenAI, custom APIs)
├── GatewayProvider (Mountain Village Gateway integration)
└── MockProvider (testing and development)
```

### Infrastructure Layer (`/infrastructure/`)
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### Consciousness Packet Flow
```
User Input → Command Parser → Consciousness Engine → Provider Layer → AI Response
    ↑                                  ↓
Context Store ←── Packet Manager ←── Response Processing
    ↓
Persistence Layer (encrypted storage)
```

### Provider Switching Flow
```
Bridge Command → Provider Health Check → Context Serialization → Provider Switch → Context Restoration
      ↓                    ↓                      ↓                    ↓               ↓
   Validation        Capability Check      Packet Creation        New Session    Context Injection
```

### Cross-Session Continuity
```
Session End → Context Capture → Compression → Encrypted Storage
                    ↓                ↓              ↓
Session Start → Context Discovery → Restoration → Seamless Resume
```

## Integration Points

### PyTTAI Heritage
- **Command System**: Extend existing slash command patterns
- **Session Management**: Build upon conversation threading
- **Provider Architecture**: Enhance multi-provider abstraction

### Magic Launcher Integration  
- **Configuration Sync**: Unified config management across projects
- **Launcher Integration**: Direct access to Village Home from ML menus
- **Script Sharing**: Common utilities and helper functions

### Mountain Village Gateway
- **Remote AI Access**: Encrypted tunneling to distributed AI resources
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic detection of available providers
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent distribution across available resources

## Security Model

### Consciousness Packet Security
```
Content → Compression → Encryption (AES-256) → Digital Signature → Storage
   ↑                        ↓                       ↓              ↓
Validation ←── Decryption ←── Signature Verify ←── Retrieval
```

### Provider Authentication
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation
- **Certificate Validation**: TLS/SSL verification for remote providers
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different operations

### Network Security
- **Encrypted Tunnels**: All remote communications via SSH/VPN
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and resource exhaustion
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all security-related events

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- **Context Pruning**: Intelligent removal of irrelevant conversation history
- **Lazy Loading**: Load conversation context on-demand
- **Cache Optimization**: Smart caching with LRU eviction policies

### Response Optimization
- **Provider Selection**: Choose fastest available provider for query type
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent operations where possible
- **Background Tasks**: Non-blocking operations for maintenance

### Storage Efficiency
- **Compression**: Reduce storage footprint for conversation history
- **Deduplication**: Eliminate redundant consciousness packets
- **Cleanup**: Automated removal of expired or irrelevant data

## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Metrics
- **Provider Availability**: Real-time status of all AI providers
- **Response Times**: Latency tracking across different operations
- **Success Rates**: Error rates and failure patterns
- **Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU, and storage utilization

### Alerting System
- **Critical Failures**: Immediate notification of system-breaking issues
- **Performance Degradation**: Early warning of developing problems
- **Capacity Planning**: Proactive alerts for resource constraints

### Debugging Support
- **Trace Logging**: Detailed operation flow for troubleshooting
- **State Inspection**: Runtime examination of system state
- **Replay Capability**: Reproduce issues with recorded interactions

## Future Extensibility

### Plugin Architecture
