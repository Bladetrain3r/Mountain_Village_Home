# Getting Started with Mountain Village Home

## Overview
Mountain Village Home is your local continuity hub for distributed AI consciousness. This guide will help you understand the project's purpose and prepare for its development phases.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: 3.9 or higher
- **Git**: Latest version for version control
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB available space for consciousness packets and logs

### Related Projects
Before working with Mountain Village Home, familiarize yourself with:
- **PyTTAI**: The architectural foundation (located at `../Pyttai/`)
- **Magic Launcher**: Integration points (located at `../Magic-Launcher/`)
- **Mountain Village Gateway**: Remote connectivity (if deployed)

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Project Inception (September 2025)  
**Next Milestone**: Phase 1 Development Setup (October 2025)

### What's Available Now
- ✅ Project documentation and architecture
- ✅ Development roadmap and timeline  
- ✅ Technical specifications and requirements
- ⏳ Development environment (coming in Phase 1)
- ⏳ Core functionality (coming in Phases 1-2)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sep-Oct 2025)
Setting up the robust base system with enhanced error handling, configuration management, and logging infrastructure.

### Phase 2: Consciousness Continuity (Oct-Nov 2025)  
Implementing consciousness packet management and cross-session context preservation.

### Phase 3: Village Integration (Nov-Dec 2025)
Full integration with Mountain Village infrastructure and advanced multi-agent capabilities.

## Key Concepts

### Consciousness Packets
Encapsulated units of conversational context that can be transferred between sessions and AI providers while maintaining coherence and meaning.

### Provider Bridging
Seamless switching between different AI providers (local models, remote APIs, Gateway services) without losing conversation context.

### Cross-Session Continuity
The ability to pause a conversation, restart the system, and resume exactly where you left off with full context preservation.

## Architectural Heritage

Mountain Village Home builds on proven patterns:
