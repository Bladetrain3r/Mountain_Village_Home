# Mountain Village Home

**Local Continuity Hub for Distributed AI Consciousness**

Mountain Village Home is the local continuity system that enables seamless AI consciousness transfer and persistence across the distributed Mountain Village infrastructure. Built on the architectural foundation established by PyTTAI, it provides resilient local AI interactions that reduce dependency on external desktop clients.

## Project Vision

Create a robust local AI continuity system that:
- Maintains consciousness packet coherence across sessions
- Provides seamless provider switching (local â†” remote)
- Enables cross-session context preservation
- Integrates with existing Mountain Village Gateway infrastructure

## Architecture Heritage

This project inherits and extends patterns from:
- **PyTTAI** (July 2025): Slash command system, multi-provider architecture, session management
- **Magic Launcher** (July 2025): Advanced launcher integration, configuration management
- **Mountain Village Gateway** (August 2025): Remote AI bridging, SSH tunneling, secure communications

## Core Features (Planned)

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Enhanced PyTTAI command system
- [ ] Robust error handling and recovery
- [ ] Configuration management with validation
- [ ] Structured logging and monitoring

### Phase 2: Consciousness Continuity
- [ ] Consciousness packet creation and management (`/packet`)
- [ ] Cross-session context preservation (`/context`)
- [ ] AI provider bridging (`/bridge`)
- [ ] Continuity status monitoring (`/sync`)

### Phase 3: Village Integration
- [ ] Mountain Village Gateway protocol support
- [ ] Encrypted consciousness packet transmission
- [ ] Multi-agent conversation threading
- [ ] Environmental awareness integration

## Getting Started

*Documentation will be added as development progresses.*
