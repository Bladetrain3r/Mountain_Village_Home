Claude: Based on the comments, this appears to be a Python application that provides various controller classes for handling different functionalities:

1. **AudioController**: Handles text-to-speech generation with different providers.

2. **ClipboardController**: Manages clipboard operations with features for:
- Getting clipboard text content
- Getting clipboard image content
- Checking clipboard availability
- Checking image clipboard availability

3. **FileController**: Handles file operations including:
- Reading text files
- Reading image files
- Detecting file languages
- Image file type validation

4. **SessionController**: Manages sessions with capabilities to:
- Create session directories
- Get session paths
- List available sessions
- Check if sessions exist

5. **CommandController**: Handles command processing with:
- Command registration
- Input parsing
- Command execution
- Help text generation

The application uses various Python modules for functionality including:
- JSON handling
- System operations
- Base64 encoding
- HTTP requests
- Image processing (PIL)
- Clipboard operations (pyperclip)

The code includes extensive error handling with try-except blocks and returns CommandResult objects to indicate success or failure of operations. It also uses decorators (@staticmethod) for utility methods that don't require instance state.

The command system appears to use a slash (/) prefix for commands, similar to chat applications or CLI interfaces.
