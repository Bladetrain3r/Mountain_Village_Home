- Provides debug output about loaded and failed providers
- Includes provider-specific commands and configuration options

3. Command System:
- Implements a built-in command system
- Has help commands for user guidance

- Implements conversation management including clearing conversations
- Handles message streaming from providers

5. Input Processing:
- Processes user input continuously in a main loop
- Handles command parsing and execution
